# Robot Assisted Mouse Positioning System (RAMPS) Guide
The main files for operating the Meca500 robot with the custom GUI are RobotControl.py and RobotGUI.py. The other files in the folder were used for position tracking with 
the Polaris Spectra optical tracking system. As of right now, I haven't made a guide for using those scripts since they probably won't be used again, so just ignore those. 
The guide for operating the robot arm is in a GoogleDoc here:

If you are using/programming the robot arm, it would be a good idea to reference the Meca500 User Manual and Programming Guide.  
In order to use the most up to date functionality in the programming guide, you must update the firmware of the robot. The firmware updates and instructions are also available on their website.
The most up to date versions of the User Manual and Programming Guide can be found below:
